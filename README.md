# Strassen-Algorithm-Research

This README will guide you through setting up and using the program to multiply matrices.

Setup

    Ensure you are in the correct file directory.
    Use a Linux machine or have WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed on your Windows machine.
    To create the executable, simply type make into the command line.

Interactive Mode

    Run the executable by typing "./run_algorithms" into the command line.
    A menu with 5 options will be displayed. Choose an option by typing a number from 1 to 5 and pressing enter.
    If prompted to print the results to the console, respond with 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no) and press enter.
    Enter a file name without a file extension for a neat output.
    When asked to enter a matrix size, provide a value of n that will be an exponent of 2, ensuring perfectly square matrices for the algorithms.
    If you choose an option regarding strassenv2, this is the combined algorithm. Enter an integer to set the cutoff n.
    Finally, enter an integer for the number of matrix pairs you want to multiply.

Import Dr. Armstrong's File

    To import file, type "./run_algorithms [file name]" into the command line.
        Note: If your file name contains spaces, please enclose the entire string in quotes.
